### Hi there, I'm Sylvain Combettes ðŸ‘‹

Since September 2024, I have been a Machine Learning Product Engineer at [Probabl](https://probabl.notion.site/Get-to-know-Probabl-127ef76d36b9804d8ca8e264e42f0cee), the official brand operator of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
I contribute to [skore](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore), the scikit-learn modeling companion.

Previously, I was a PhD student, at [Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ã‰cole_normale_supÃ©rieure_Paris-Saclay) (France), where I worked on machine learning applied to time series. More precisely, my research focused on symbolic representation for time series, as well as distance measures on them.

ðŸ“‚ I've recently [Dec 2024] started to organize my GitHub stars into lists: see [my stars](https://github.com/sylvaincom?tab=stars).
